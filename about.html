<h3>About</h3>
<br>
<h4>This digital humanities project is a mixed method investigation into the case for reparations in the Anglophone Caribbean with a heightened emphasis on Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. In it, I explore several facets of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the University of Glasgow and the University of the West Indies in the summer of 2019. In interpreting this gesture of solidarity, I propose strategies towards the development of what I term speculative datasets, i.e, a dataset that is formed by what is not known or quantified and is supplanted by interventions such as prose or instances of affect. As Saidiya Hartman puts forward in her seminal text Lose Your Mother, we are living in the afterlife of slavery, an era where anti-Blackness and denial of that fact fuels all socioeconomic development today. Through the framework of this prose poem, I present the viewer with examples of available datasets in the first half (what I can find) and with more affective/qualitative data in the second half (what I can't find), using Fred Moten's notion of the incalculable debt. Through a combination of prose and data analysis, I aim to generate a site of unease in this space triangulated by the paid, the unpaid and a debt that announces itself by virtue of the lack of effort to speak to it directly.
<br>
<br>
While researching potential datasets about reparations in the Caribbean, I found myself at a loss. While there was no shortage of datasets that quantified the symptoms of a need for reparations, the inabiltiy to quantify efforts towards actually acheving reparative justice for the decendants of chattel slavery in the Anglophone Caribbean proved to be difficult. I theorize that this lack of datasets is indicative of a limit to the (post)-Colonial imagination, both in the Caribbean and in the Western world. This displacement of the imaginary requires new modes of investigation that allows for inquiry into what can be read as an “incalculable sum”, one that defines itself by a debt that transcends the dollar value. </h4>
<br>
<h3>The establishment of the CARICOM Reparations Commission and the Center for Reparations Research</h3>

<h4>In the past, there have been efforts by Caribbean scholars, most visibly by Barbadian historian and Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies, Sir. Hilary McDonald Beckles and Jamaican historian Dr. Verene Shepherd, also of the University of the West Indies, to make the case for reparations of the descendants of the formerly enslaved in the Caribbean. Beckles and Shepherd both serve as chairman and co-chair, respectively, of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)’s initiative for reparations, the CARICOM Reparations Commission (CRC). Formed in 2013 after a recommendation by the then Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dr. The Honorable Ralph Gonsalves for compensation from colonial powers, the CRC seeks to,

Establish the moral, ethical and legal case for the payment of Reparations by the Governments of all the former colonial powers and the relevant institutions of those countries, to the nations and people of the Caribbean Community for the Crimes against Humanity of Native Genocide, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and a racialized system of chattel Slavery.

As of 2019, the CRC counts twelve member states across the Anglophone, Francophone and Néerlandophone Caribbean. Furthermore, Dr. Shepherd now helms operations at the Center for Reparation Research, an initiative housed at the University of the West Indies in solidarity with the efforts of the CRC. Through the efforts of both of these initiatives, UWI was able to begin planning the reception of £200 million from the University of Glasgow in 2018. </h4>

<h3> Health and Education in Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow </h3>

<h4> To frame reparations as something that is unachievable due to the fluctuation of the global market over time or as a cost that taxpayers in the global north should not be responsible for indicates a gross neglect of the reality of said countries economic foundations. The CRC explicitly states this refusal as core to their organizing:

The CRC operates within the context of persistent objection from European governments to its mandate. The CRC, nonetheless, is optimistic that the CRJP will gain acceptance as a necessary path to progress.
<br>
<br>
<br>

On the other hand, it cannot be argued that the cost of chattel slavey has indeed transcended a dollar amount. Therefore, determining the amount that people must be repaid must use a process that hybridizes both economics and affect. What causes this limit to the imagination? One could argue that the resources to come up with a definite number are few. This is offset by the fact that quantifying this should not be a financial burden undertaken by Caribbean nations but rather that these efforts should be funded by European institutions/taxpayers whose very lives are testaments to a debt unpaid and the structural inequality that such lives engender. For example, the University of Glasgow has developed a partnership with the University of the West Indies wherein they acknowledge their complicity in chattel slavery by agreeing to pay £200 million “in cash and in kind” to UWI. In the report Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow, UoG explicitly traces their current wealth to grants and bursaries from slave owners in colonial Jamaica prior to Emancipation. They funded their own research and identified UWI as the recipient of these funds.

Here, we can see the increase in chattel slavery by European colonists in the New World. The dataset used here was culled from a custom query on the University College of London's database of the legacies of slave-owners in the New World. It includes the names of the captains of ships that sailed to the Caribbean and the Americas. By including the name of these captains, I aim to highlight their complicity in the horrors of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, just as plainly as the report produced by the University of Glasgow condemns slave-owners. The amount of enslaved people trafficked during this period amounts to 5,062,169. This does not account for lost of life once they arrived on the islands and were exposed to local illnesses or loss of life due to sheer cruelty.

<br>
<br>

In this chart, we can see where the majority of enslaved people were made to labour in the New World. After Brazil and Haiti, Jamaica (listed here as Kingston and a host of smaller ports) had the most enslaved people being forced to labour in service of colonial interests. This data came from the same set as the one above.

<br>
<br>
<br>

However, I question the effectiveness of a reparative effort made only through institution-to-institution interventions. University of Glasgow aims to invest in the education of young Caribbean people through awarding of scholarships and other types of financial aid, but how does this account for the fact that due to chattel slavery, only a few can benefit from these offerings to begin with? For instance, while education is subsidized by the government in Trinidad and Tobago, in Jamaica, primary and secondary schools are not, severely limiting the pool of those from that country who are able to make it to tertiary level education regardless of ability and/or potential. Furthermore, it is against the law to send a child to not send a child to school. Therefore, if one cannot afford a child’s school fees, they are subject to punitive measures by the state. (insert viz about education in Jamaica and household). Affectively, this manifests itself as a schism between the paradigm of uptown and downtown, making wider both the wealth gap and the vitriol between wealthy and low-income Jamaicans. I argue that by only funding tertiary level education, the larger issue, that is, lack of  access to education in general, is sidelined in favour of funding a privilege that only a few can benefit from. In both Jamaica and Trinidad, the education systems draw from colonial design with adjustments made over the years since Independence from the British Crown that reflect each countries’ subjectivity. With reparations being applied in the right context, people in the Anglophone Caribbean can begin to take steps to narrow the gap in education (in both classroom and trade settings) and finetune their own education systems, making them more tailored to their needs. Furthermore, both islands are often affected by brain drain at the tertiary level. Only awarding scholarships at the tertiary level may exacerbate this. Also, in the event that these scholarships are only awarded to students in particular fields as determined by the state, it bolsters the assumption that reparations is something that one works to deserve, rather than an inalienable right. I surmise that while it is necessary for students to be able to travel and expand their worldview, it is of equal importance that they feel clear and able in their decision to do so via access to a more substantial educational background.

In this bar chart made from a dataset detailing the enrollment statistics of Jamaican schools by parish in 2016, we can see that enrollment begins to decline after Grade 11, which is when students take the regional qualification exam called CXC. After completing CXC, many students chose to not continue with secondary school as it is the base requirement for entry-level employment in many sectors in the workforce. However, students who desire to complete tertiary education at a university are required to complete Grades 12 and 13, a more rigourous courseload with a higer cost attached that many cannot afford. Viewed alongside the following vizualization, we can also see that the parish with the highest amount of continuing students come from the parish of St. Andrew. St. Andrew is a densely populated parish that is close to the capital, Kingston. Living near to the capital may afford families employment opportunities that those in vast, rural communities such as Clarendon and Westmoreland are not privy to. It is also worth noting that the University of the West Indies is also in Kingston proper. Therefore, funding scholarships for a select pool of students based on false ideas of merit when it is really a matter of opportunity, makes reparations inaccessible to those for whom it may be most urgent.

Another example of infrastructural intervention is the proposed diabetes research center. The report identifies diabetes as a prevailing health condition and prioritizes research into reducing its’ impact (among that of others such as hypertension and childhood obesity) on the Black Caribbean population. However, this research has precedent in similar studies among Black populations in the US and the UK. That said, would this research consist of analyzing food trends in the Caribbean? When these foods and habits are identified, will the report also include their histories as they stand within the Black Caribbean palette? Studies in the US, such as Michael Twitty’s work regarding the culinary legacies of the formerly enslaved, have found that contemporary Black American eating habits have been heavily informed by and passed down by the descendants of the formerly enslaved. People were often only allowed what was left of food products after the choice parts were reserved for plantation/slave owners. These foods maintained their position in the Black American community as they became instrumental to the formation of traditions, mythologies and family dynamics that were then passed down. Similar processes took place in Black Caribbean communities as well. Therefore, what would research around diabetes in the Caribbean look like with these affective considerations in mind? Would a type of analysis that is less paternal in nature be more effective? In an attempt to speculate a hybridized data collection methodology for an endeavour such as this, I propose, for instance, interviews with Black Caribbean families about their eating habits and their knowledge of the histories of the food they eat. These interviews would be publicly accessible alongside the more traditional style of the dataset, as they provide an affective framework that moves the data from being solely numbers to being a tool by which citizens have an active hand in developing a new relationship to food and tradition. Using money gained from reparative justice to fund such studies would prove to be instrumental. This is an instance in which reparations can make more room for Black Caribbean people to develop community based strategies for the development of community based strategies for healthier lives and legacies that do not revolve around invoking shame as a method of controlling weight, and health in general. Alternatively, what would an intervention into increasing the accessibility of medicine look like? <br/

<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<br>

<h4> It is my desire to make this a more robust study in the future. However, in closing, I emphasize the importance of employing holistic data collection methodologies that restore some iteration of humanity to these numbers. Through my prose, I hoped to rouse a fraction of the sense of frustration that debt--especially debt of this nature--can produce in people to whom it is owed. </h4>
